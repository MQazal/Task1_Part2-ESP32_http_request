# Task1_Part2-ESP32_http_request

For the second part of first task of robot control panel, I used http request in ESP32 code to get last direction from database by simulation with light turning on when request is successfully processed and getting correct direction, but in this case I used Smart Mehods company links to help me achieve that goal of this task because I faced many problems with hosting services as I have experienced many of them, so thank you so much for supporting me in this difficult task.
